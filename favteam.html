                <h2>About The Buccaneers</h2>
                <p>
                    The club joined the NFL in 1976 as an expansion team, along with the Seattle Seahawks, and played its first season in the American Football Conference (AFC) West division. 
                    Prior to the 1977 season, Tampa Bay switched conferences and divisions with Seattle, becoming a member of the NFC Central division. 
                    As a result of the league's realignment prior to the 2002 season, the Buccaneers joined three former NFC West teams to form the NFC South. 
                    The club is owned by the Glazer family and plays its home games at Raymond James Stadium (Pictured Below) in Tampa. The mascot for the Tampa Bay 
                    Buccanners is Captain Fear!

                The Buccanners when they first joined the NFL in 1976 struggled a little. Today the Buccaneers have won 2 Superbowls and are considered a good team 
                in the league!
