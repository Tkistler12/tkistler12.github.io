            <p>The National Football League (NFL) is a professional American Football league. It is one of the 
                major professional sport leagues in the United States. The NFL is the highest level of American 
                football in the world. There are other leagues such as the Canadian Football League (CFL) but it 
                is considered to be a lower level league when compared to the NFL.

                Football Conference (NFC). Each one of these conferences has a total of 16 teams each, 32 teams in 
                total. Within each conference these 16 teams are divided equally between 4 divisions North, South, 
                East, West.

            <p> 
                NFL games have 4 quarters that are 15 minutes each, 60 minutes total. There is a 12 minutes halftime between 
                the 2nd and 3rd quarter. The field is 360 feet long and 160 feet wide. There is a touchdown and goal posts at
                the end of both sides. The team at the end, with the most points when the time runs out it the WINNER!!!
            </p>
            <div class="container">
            <div class="text-center">
            <img id = "NFL_field" src = "field.png" alt = "NFL Field" width = "500">
            </div>

        
            <p>
                There are a total of 5 ways to score points in a game: 
                <ol id = "score_list">
                    <li>Touchdown = 6 points</li>
                    <li>Field Goal = 3 points</li>
                    <li>Safety = 2 points</li>
                </ol>
                After a touchdown you get two options to get additional points:</p>
                <ol id ="score_list_2">
                    <li value = "4">Extra point = 1 point</li>
                    <li value = "5">Two-point conversion = 2 points</li>
                 </ol>

                 To score a touchdown you must pass or run the ball across the touchdown line at either end of the field. Field 
                 Goals are scored by kicking the ball between the uprights of the goal post (Pictured below). A safety 
                 occurs when you tackle the opposing teams ball carrier in their own endzone. After a touchdown you can either kick
                 the ball  between the goal post from a close range for 1 extra point or try to run or pass it in from a close range
                 for 2 extra points.

            <h2>Playoffs and Superbowl</h2>
            <p> 
                The teams in the NFL all have one goal and that is to make it to the playoffs and win the superbowl. The superbowl 
                is a game between the two best teams in the league that year to decide who is the best. To get to the superbowl teams 
                must make it through the playoffs. Following the conclusion of the regular season, the NFL Playoffs, a 14-team single-elimination tournament, is then held. 
                Seven teams are selected from each conference: the winners of each of the four divisions as well as three wild card teams (the three remaining teams with the best overall record, with tiebreakers in the event of two or more teams having the same record). 
                These teams are seeded according to overall record and tiebreakers, with the division champions always ranking higher than the wild card teams.[88] 
                The top team (seeded one) from each conference are awarded a bye week, while the remaining six teams (seeded 2–7) from each conference compete in the first round of the playoffs, the Wild Card round, with the 2-seed competing against the 7-seed, the 3-seed competing against the 6-seed and the 4-seed competing against the 5-seed. 
                The winners of the Wild Card round advance to the Divisional Round, which matches the lower seeded team against the 1-seed and the two remaining teams against each other. 
                The winners of those games then compete in the Conference Championships, with the higher remaining seed hosting the lower remaining seed. 
                The AFC and NFC champions then compete in the Super Bowl to determine the league champion. The winner is then presented with the Lombardi Trophy(pictured below).
